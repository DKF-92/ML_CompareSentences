# ML_CompareSentences
Machine Learning script to compare sentences for similarity, this program essentially takes a csv file with statement questions taken from Quora (data found on kaggle), uses them to create a model, then allows the user to enter their own statements co compare against the original.
As I am just starting my machine learning education the purpose of this project is entirely education.
