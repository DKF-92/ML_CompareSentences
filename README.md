# ML_CompareSentences

The purpose behind this project came from an issue with naming conventions of file names. I was approached by another team at my company who had many related files all named using different formats. My task was to write a program that can compare different statements in a CSV file and compare for how similar they are to one another.

Please note: the 2 CSV files used for this project are sample files, the originals can't be used for data protection rules. As this is a personal GitHub this was the agreed upon way to share my project.
